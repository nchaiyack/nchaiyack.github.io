    <p>When I grow up, I want to be a statistical consultant for applied social psychologists doing real world stuff. I love taking all sorts of statistics methods classes â€“ SEM, multilevel modelling, survival analysis, psychometrics, cluster models with correlated covariances, etc...</p>

    <h2>Open-Source Software on GitHub</h2>
    <p>I've been getting back into coding; I do small projects that involve numerics. Currently, I only have:</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1em;">
      <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nchaiyack/nchaiyack.github.io/refs/heads/main/random-storage/color-detection-diagnostic.c">color-detection-diagnostic.c</a> 
      Mini-utility exercising multiple methods to determine terminal colour capabilites on *nix platforms -
          environment variables, 'ncurses', xterm-style Primary/Secondary Device Attribute queries, true-colour roundtripping,
          a visual demo, and process name detection.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1em;">
      <a href="https://github.com/nchaiyack/libfixmathmatrix.h">libfixmathmatrix</a> 
      A header-only (+ optional source file) amalgamation of a 32-bit fixed-point numerics and linear algebra library.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1em;">
      <a href="https://github.com/nchaiyack/minivmac">DazzlerGFX, heavily <em>WIP/playground</em></a> 
      Mini vMac, modified to add a virtual "PDS expansion card" to the Macintosh SE platform. It currently has a general-purpose framework with (a) a whopping ~1 MB of shared on-device memory that can be accessed without any latency, and (b) the ability to asynchronously execute 7 commands at once. Just no actual functionality to emulate yet! You could probably even do DMA copies in one (emulated) cycle.
    </p>
    <h2>Writeups</h2>
    <p>I learn things by writing them up. Here are some of the things I've been learning recently.</p>
    <p><em>Caveat emptor:</em> I'm not good enough at math to do derivations from scratch, so heavily rely on ChatGPT to give me rigorous mathematical derivations and arguments. For full transparency, I attach the prompts I used at the end.</p>
