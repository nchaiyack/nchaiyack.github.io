          <h2>A bit about me.</h2>
          <p>
            I am a quantitative researcher in the applied social and health sciences. I currently have the privilege of
            doing autism research in both community-participatory and epidemiological contexts. For fun, I take too many
            quantitative methods courses. (My graduate program directors can testify to the headaches I've given them!)
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe the most original research comes from interdisciplinary work within the social and health
            sciences, and dialogue between their statistical lenses, despite differences in language.
          </p>
          <p>
            I aspire to be a statistical polyglot. So I've spent a lot of my career building a wide statistical toolbox.
            I've had the privilege to work with/learn from from social psychologists, survey statisticians,
            psychometricians, high-performance computing engineers, geostatisticians, and epidemiologists.

              I learn things by writing them up. Unfortunately, since grad school is killing me, I don't have a lot of
              time to wring things up. Nevertheless, here are some of the things I've been learning recently.

            <p>
              <strong>Unfortunately paywalled!</strong> Me and a research mentor, Dr. Katharine Zuckerman, co-authored a
              mini "op-ed" in the newsletter of the American Academy of Pediatrics about how autistic kids in crisis can
              be treated better by pediatric urgent care providers and hospitals.
            </p>
            <p>
              A great deal, if not all, of these is true for autistic adults, and adults with disabilities in general.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pediatricians are awesome. This benefitted heavily from the experiences of Dr. Zuckerman and her
              pediatrician colleagues who have thought a great deal about trauma-informed care of kids with autism (and
              other disabilities); especially those who experience crisis a great deal.

              microprocessors actually keep track of instructions "in flight"? Here's an old document by Maynard Handley
              providing a surprisingly accessible nuts-and-bolts description of the microarchitecture of Apple's M1.
