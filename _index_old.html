      <p> <b>A bit about me. </b>I am a quantitative researcher in the
        applied social and health sciences. I currently have the
        privilege of doing autism research in both
        community-participatory and epidemiological contexts. For fun, I
        take too many quantitative methods courses. (My graduate program
        directors can testify to the headaches I've given them!) </p>
      <p> I aspire to be a statistical polyglot. So I've spent a lot of
        my career building a wide statistical toolbox: I've had the
        privilege to work with/learn from from social psychologists,
        survey statisticians, psychometricians, high-performance
        computing engineers, geostatisticians, and epidemiologists. </p>
      <p>I have three core beliefs:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> The most original research and statistical thinking comes
          from interdisciplinary work, and dialogue between the
          different statistical lenses of different fields in the social
          and health sciences. </li>
        <li> Statistical models are the language of testable hypotheses
          – and that the more tools we have, the more questions we can
          rigorously ask and seek evidence for. <br>
        </li>
